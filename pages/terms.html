			<p>The current page is here to explain the terms of use in the Game Hallows community. You must follow them at whole time.</p>
			<h2 class="text-blue-500 text-2xl font-bold">Be respectful, responsible & don't use bad words</h2>
			<p>It may sound obvious, but bad words are forbidden. If someone is bothering you just mention a people in the staff and see what happens ;) | Using hard bad words may lead you to be sanctionned with magnitude.</p>
			<h2 class="text-blue-500 text-2xl font-bold">Don't spam, flood or advertise</h2>
			<p>Spamming is forbidden as it pollutes the text channels. It is not funny to find a little message beyond tenths of useless messages.</p>
			<h2 class="text-blue-500 text-2xl font-bold">Don't lend, sell, steal or leave any account</h2>
			<p>Lending or selling an account is forbidden by the <a href="https://discord.com/tos" class="text-orange-500" target="_blank">Discord ToS</a>. Stealing an account may be illegal, I don't know... Leaving accounts on our server will perturbate our server statistics.</p>
